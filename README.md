Project Title: ConnectTel Customer Churn Prediction

Problem Statement

ConnectTel, a leading telecommunications company, aims to improve customer retention by accurately predicting customer churn. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, this project seeks to identify key factors influencing churn and develop a robust predictive model.

Data

The dataset used for this project contains the dataset has 7043 records and 21 features

Data Preprocessing

The data underwent preprocessing steps, including:

•	Handling Missing Values

•	Handling Duplicates

•	Feature Analysis: Univariate and Bivariate analysis was carried out to understand the features better and gain actionable insights

•	Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.

•	Feature Scaling: Standardizing/normalizing numerical features to ensure fair comparison was done using MinMax scaler.

•	Encoding Categorical Features: Converting categorical features into numerical format using label encoding and one-hot encoding.

Model Selection and Training

Several machine learning algorithms were explored, including:

•	Logistic Regression

•	SGD Classifier

•	Random Forest

•	Decision Tree

•	XGBoost

•	SVC

Model Training

The model training process involves the following steps:

1.	Model Selection: Choosing an appropriate machine learning algorithm (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SGD classifier, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVC).

2.	Model Training: Training the selected model on the preprocessed training data.

3.	Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing the model's hyperparameters to improve performance.

Model Evaluation

The trained model is evaluated using various metrics:

•	Accuracy: Proportion of correctly classified instances.

•	Precision: Proportion of positive predictions that are actually positive.

•	Recall: Proportion of actual positive cases that are correctly identified.

•	F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.

•	Confusion Matrix: A table showing the number of correct and incorrect predictions.
